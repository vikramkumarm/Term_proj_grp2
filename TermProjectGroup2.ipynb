    "The present work is aimed to find the minimum angle that a wedged shaped concrete dam must subtend so as to avoid any tensile stress developed in the dam. Since concrete is a non-linear, non-elastic and brittle material which is strong in compression but it has essentially zero strength in tension, it is almost always used as reinforced concrete. Also concrete behaves non-linearly under tension hence we avoid any tensile stress in the whole structure. The implementation of problem is done solely on Jupyter Notebook, however some complex plots were developed by Matlab."
